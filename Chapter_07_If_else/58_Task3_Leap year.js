/*Problem: Take a year and check if it's a leap year.

Rules:

Divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 → Leap year

OR divisible by 400 → Leap year

Else → Not a leap year*/

let year = 2001;

if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0) {
    console.log(year + " is a leap year")
}
else {
    console.log(year + " is not leap year")

}
